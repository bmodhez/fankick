4. **Consistent Style**: Maintain similar lighting/background
5. **File Names**: Use descriptive names before upload

### **For Bulk Upload**:
1. **Organize Before Upload**: Sort images by category first
2. **Use Tags**: Add relevant tags for easy searching later
3. **Batch Processing**: Upload similar images together
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove unused images periodically
5. **Backup Strategy**: Keep local backups of important images
