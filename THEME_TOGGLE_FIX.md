# Theme Toggle Visibility Fix

## Problem
The theme toggle button was not visible in light theme because it was using hardcoded `text-white` class, making it invisible on white backgrounds.

## Root Cause
In `client/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`, the button had:
```tsx
className="text-white hover:text-primary"
```

This caused the button to be invisible in light theme where the background is white.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed ThemeToggle Component
**File**: `client/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`
```tsx
// Before
className="text-white hover:text-primary"

// After  
className="text-foreground hover:text-primary"
```

### 2. Added Theme Toggle to Mobile Menu
**File**: `client/components/Navigation.tsx`
- Added theme toggle section in mobile menu
- Positioned after search button with proper styling
- Added border separator and proper spacing

```tsx
{/* Theme Toggle in Mobile Menu */}
<div className="px-3 py-2 border-t border-border mt-2 pt-4">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
    <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Theme</span>
    <ThemeToggle />
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Fixed Mobile Menu Colors
- Updated border colors: `border-gray-800` → `border-border`
- Fixed link colors: Added `text-foreground` and changed hover background to `hover:bg-secondary`

## Theme Classes Used

### Text Colors
- `text-foreground` - Adapts to theme (dark in light theme, light in dark theme)
- `text-muted-foreground` - Secondary text that adapts to theme

### Background Colors
- `hover:bg-secondary` - Theme-aware secondary background for hovers

### Border Colors
- `border-border` - Standard border color that adapts to theme
