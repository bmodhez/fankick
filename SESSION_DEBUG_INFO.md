# Session Management Debug Info

## Issue: Session Verification Failed

The "Invalid or expired session" error occurs because:

### Root Cause

- **In-Memory Sessions**: Sessions are stored in a JavaScript `Map` in memory
- **Server Restarts**: Every dev server restart clears all sessions
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload and file changes restart the server frequently

### What Happens

1. User logs in successfully â†’ Session stored in memory + localStorage
2. Developer makes code changes â†’ Vite restarts server
3. Memory sessions are cleared â†’ localStorage session becomes invalid
4. Next page load â†’ Session verification fails with 401 error

### Current Fixes Applied

âœ… **Improved Error Handling**: Session failures are now handled gracefully
âœ… **Better Logging**: Debug info shows when sessions fail due to server restart
âœ… **User-Friendly Messages**: No scary error messages for normal session expiry
âœ… **Auto-Cleanup**: Invalid sessions are automatically cleared from localStorage

### For Users

- **Expected Behavior**: Session verification errors after server restarts are normal
- **Solution**: Simply login again using the demo login button
- **No Data Loss**: All other features work normally

### For Production

In production, sessions would typically be:

- Stored in Redis/Database for persistence
- Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Have longer expiry times
- Not affected by server restarts

### Demo Login

Use the demo credentials for easy testing:

- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `password123`
- Or click "ðŸš€ Try Demo Login" button
